/* CsdOsdWindow is an "on-screen-display" window (OSD).  It is the cute,
 * semi-transparent, curved popup that appears when you press a hotkey global to
 * the desktop, such as to change the volume, switch your monitor's parameters,
 * etc.
 *
 * You can create a CsdOsdWindow and use it as a normal GtkWindow.  It will
 * automatically center itself, figure out if it needs to be composited, etc.
 * Just pack your widgets in it, sit back, and enjoy the ride.
